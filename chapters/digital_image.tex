\section{The Digital Image}

An image is simply a continuous function over 2 or 3 variables (XY-coordinates and possibly time). Usually we use brightness as the value of the function, but other physical values can also be used. For a computer this is just a collection of numbers, but instead of continuous values we have discrete. 

It is important to know that \textbf{pixels are not little squares}, they are point measurements.
